Hello all, I am glad that i got an internship opportunity to work as an intern in the domain DataScience at OASISINFOBYTE. Here I will be doing tasks related to data science using python. During my internship, I have the chance to work on real-world data science projects and gain hands-on experience in the data collection, analysis and model development. Data science is an ever-evolving field that has a profound impact on industries across the board. It empowers organizations to harness the power of data to make informed decisions, optimize operations, and drive innovation.

Task-1:The Iris flower classification is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and statistics. It refers to the classification of iris flowers into one of three species based on four features: the lengths and the widths of the sepals and petals. The dataset for this problem, the Iris dataset, is commonly used as a beginner's dataset for machine learning classification problems.

Task-2: Unemployment analysis The analysis of unemployment in India was conducted using Python, focusing on a dataset encompassing key indicators such as the unemployment rate, employed count, labour participation rate, and regional data. After data loading and preprocessing, visualizations were created to portray trends and patterns. The line plot depicted the fluctuation in the estimated unemployment rate over time, shedding light on the impact of different events or periods on unemployment. Additionally, trends in employed counts and labour participation rates were displayed, offering insights into the dynamics of the labour force. The analysis also provided a regional perspective by visualizing the mean unemployment rates, enabling a comparative view of different regions. These visualizations, combined with exploratory data analysis, contribute to a better understanding of the unemployment scenario in India, aiding policymakers and researchers in informed decision-making.

Task-3:  Car Price Prediction Car price prediction refers to the use of statistical and machine learning models to estimate the selling price of automobiles. It is a critical task in the automotive industry, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions. This prediction relies on various factors, including the car's specifications, market trends, and historical data.

Here we used Random Forest Machine Learning Algorithm as the data set contains various dataitems of different categories.

We had used pandas dummies to replace the string data items with integers and applied randomforest algorithm and findout the accuracy using some tools like mean suared error, mean absolute error and r2_score.
